## Overview

evaluator is an open source quantitative risk analysis toolkit. Based on the OpenFAIR 
[ontology](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13K) and 
risk assessment [standard](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13G), 
evaluator empowers an organization to perform a quantifiable, repeatable, and 
data-driven risk review.

Three sample outputs of this toolkit are available:

1) A [sample risk analysis](https://evaluator.tidyrisk.org/reports/evaluator_risk_analysis.html) report
2) A one page [risk dashboard](https://evaluator.tidyrisk.org/reports/evaluator_risk_dashboard.html)
3) A demonstration copy of [Scenario Explorer](https://davidski.shinyapps.io/scenario_explorer) 

## Installation

Install evaluator via the standard CRAN mechanisms. If you wish to use the 
optional, but recommended, reporting functions, also install the 
suggested dependencies. These additional packages are not needed for 
modeling, but are used in the generation of reports.

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("evaluator", dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you wish to run the development (and potentially bleeding edge) version of 
evaluator, you can install directly from GitHub with the following `devtools` 
command.

```{r github_install, eval=FALSE}
# install.pacakges("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidski/evaluator", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Optionally, Docker images with all dependencies pre-installed are
available on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tidyrisk).

## Usage

The primary workflow for evaluator involves gathering data in Excel then 
running the analysis from within the R and Evaluator environment:

From Excel:

1. Populate the evaluator-supplied data acquisition spreadsheet

From Evaluator:

2. Import the data
3. Prepare the data for simulation
4. Run the simulations
5. Summarize the results
6. Generate draft reports for customization

A detailed guide is available in the vignette accessed via 
`vignette("usage", package="evaluator")`. A short screencast showing 
the basic workflow (not including generation of reports) is available below:

## Where to Go from Here

While evaluator is a powerful tool, it does not attempt to address interactions 
between risk scenarios, rolling up multiple levels of risk into aggregations, or 
other advanced topics. As you become more comfortable with quantitative risk 
analysis, you may wish to dive deeper into these areas (and I hope you do!). 
The following resources may help you explore these and other topics in risk 
management.
