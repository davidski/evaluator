## Overview

Evaluator is an open source quantitative risk analysis toolkit. Based on the OpenFAIR 
[taxonomy](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13K) and 
risk assessment [standard](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13G), 
Evaluator empowers an organization to perform a quantifiable, repeatable, and 
data-driven risk review.

Three sample outputs of this toolkit are available:

1) A detailed risk analysis template, located at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/davidski/evaluator_risk_analysis)
2) A one page risk dashboard, also located at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/davidski/evaluator_risk_dashboard)
3) A demonstration copy of [Scenario Explorer](https://davidski.shinyapps.io/scenario_explorer) 

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("evaluator")

# Optionally, to install the development verison from GitHub
# install.pacakges("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidski/evaluator")
```

Optionally, a prototype Docker image is available on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidski/evaluator-docker/).

## Usage

The primary workflow for Evaluator involves gathering data in Excel then 
running the analysis from within the R and Evaluator environment:

From Excel:

1. Populate the Evaluator-supplied data acquisition spreadsheet

From Evaluator:

2. Import the data
3. Prepare the data for simulation
4. Run the simulations
5. Summarize the results
6. Generate draft reports for customization

A detailed guide is available in the vignette accessed via 
`vignette("usage", package="evaluator")`. A short screencast showing 
the basic workflow (not including generation of reports) is available below:

## Where to Go from Here

While Evaluator is a powerful tool, it does not attempt to address interactions 
between risk scenarios, rolling up multiple levels of risk into aggregations, or 
other advanced topics. As you become more comfortable with quantitative risk 
analysis, you may wish to dive deeper into these areas (and I hope you do!). 
The following resources may help you explore these and other topics in risk 
management.
