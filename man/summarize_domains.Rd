\title{Create domain-level summary of simulation results}
\usage{
summarize_domains(simulation_results, domains)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_results}{Simulation results dataframe.}

\item{domains}{Domain mappings dataframe.}
}
\value{
Simulation results summarized by domain
}
\description{
Given a dataframe of raw results from \code{run_simulations}, summarize
the individual results at a per-domain level. This domain-level summary
is a useful data structure for aggregate reporting.
}
\details{
Summary stats created include:
\itemize{
\item Mean/Min/Max/Median are calculated for loss events
\item Median/Max/VaR are calculated for annual loss expected (ALE)
\item Mean/Median/Max/Min are calculated for single loss expected (SLE)
\item Mean percentage of theat capability exceeding difficulty on succesfull threat events
\item Mean percentage of difficulty exceeding threat capability on defended events
\item Vulnerability percentage
\item Z-score of ALE (outliers flagged as 2 >= z-score)
}
}
\examples{
data(simulation_results)
data(domains)
summarize_domains(simulation_results, domains)
